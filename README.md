## Gameplay
The player starts from the village which has hidden portals all around it. Once the player finds a portal, they can jump in and complete a 2D platformer level. They will meet a new character during every level, which will be either a non-playable or playable character. After completing the level, the portal closes and disappears.

The objective is to close all the portals and rescue all the characters. At the start of the game, the player will have only one playable character, but after clearing the portals, they will unlock more heroes. Before starting the level, the player gets to choose which character they want to use.
